# CONTROL STRUCTURES

## 1. Decision Statement

1. Watch the videos on using **if-then-else** conditional statements:

    <https://youtu.be/FvMPfrgGeKs?feature=shared>

    > In your free time you can also watch other videos available on the Internet, such as:  
        <https://youtu.be/Zp5MuPOtsSY?feature=shared>  
        <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er->

1. Decision statements in Python are used to make decisions based on logical conditions. The main decision-making structure is the if statement, which allows a block of code to be executed if a given condition is true.

    Familiarise yourself with the basic **if** statement syntax:

    ```python
    if condition:
        # code to execute if the condition is true
    else:
        # code to execute if the condition is false
        # (note that else is optional)
    ```

1. The speed limit on a motorway in Poland is 140 km/h. The following program
    checks whether a car exceeded the speed limit. If so, a warning
    is printed. Complete the program.

    ```python
    ###
    # Checking whether a car exceeded the speed limit
    #
    speed_limit = 140
    car_speed = int( input('Enter car speed (km/h): ') )
    
    if car_speed ...:
        print(f'Your speed is {...}km/h')
        print('Warning: speed limit exceeded!!')
    ```

1. A payment terminal in a store allows card payments. The customer has money in his bank account. The total value of purchases is given. The terminal prints a message whether the payment can be made or whether there are no funds in the customer's bank account. Write a program that acts as a payment terminal. Then, use the program and pay for the purchases below.

    140, 499, 500, 501, 720 (for the last two amounts, there are no funds)

    ```python
    ###
    # Credit card payment 
    #
    account_balance = 500
    total_payment = input ...
    
    if total_payment ... account_balance:
        print('Payment completed')
    else:
        print('No funds')
    ```

1. A test is passed when the number of correctly completed tasks is at
    least 50%. Write a program that checks whether the test is passed. Then use the program to check if you passed the test for the following number of properly performed tasks:

    20, 11, 10, 9, 0 

    ```python
    ###
    # Checking whether the test is passed
    # Test is passed when the number of correctly completed
    # tasks is at least 50%
    #
    total_tasks = 20
    tasks_ok = ...
    test_passed = False
    
    if tasks_ok ... total_tasks ... :
        test_passed = True
    
    if test_passed:
        print('Congratulations! You passed the test.')
    else:
        print('Unfortunately, you failed the test.')
    ```

1. Write a program that checks whether the number entered from the
    keyboard is even or odd.

    ```python
    ###
    # Checking whether the number
    # entered from the keyboard is even or odd 
    #
    number = int(input('Enter number: '))
    
    if number % 2 ...:
        print(f'{...} is even')
    else:
        print(f'{...} is odd')
    ```

1. The employee's basic salary is PLN 5000. The employee may receive a bonus of several percent of the basic salary. Write a program that calculates the employee's salary, taking into account the possibility of receiving a bonus. Then calculate the employee's total salary for the following cases:

    * The employee does not receive a bonus
    * The employee receives a bonus of 30%

    ```python
    ###
    # Program that calculates the employee's salary,
    # taking into account the possibility of receiving a bonus.
    #
    basic_salary = 5000
    total_salary = 0
    bonus = 0.15 # 15%
    is_bonus = input('Does the employee receive a bonus? (Y/N):') == 'Y'

    if is_bonus:
        total_salary = ...
    else:
        ...
    
    print('Basic salary: {...}')
    print('Bonus included? {...}')
    print('Total salary: {...}')
    ```


## 2. Multiple Conditions

1. In Python, **elif** (short for "else if") is used in conditional statements to check additional conditions if the previous **if** or **elif** was false. It allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on which condition is true. Using **elif** helps avoid nesting multiple **if** statements, making the code more readable and manageable.

    Notice the basic syntax of the **elif** statement:

    ```python
    if condition1:
        # code to execute if condition1 is true
    elif condition2:
        # code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
    elif condition3:
        # code to execute if condition2 is false and condition3 is true
    else:
        # code to execute if all the above conditions are false
    ```

    * The elif statement is only executed if the previous **if** (or **elif**) condition is false.
    * You can use as many **elif** statements as needed.
    * Optionally, you can have an **else** statement at the end, which will execute if none of the conditions are true.

1. Clothing sizes are often labeled with letter symbols. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a clothing size and then prints a verbal description of the clothing size, as below.

    * S: Small size
    * M: Medium size
    * L: Large size
    * XL: Extra large size
    * Incorrect symbol (if entered symbol dirrerent than S, M, L, XL)

    Then check the correctness of the program for each of the size symbols.

    ```python
    ###
    # A program for checking clothing sizes
    # S: Small size, M: Medium size, L: Large size
    # XL: Extra large size or Incorrect symbol (if entered symbol
    # dirrerent than S, M, L, XL)
    #
    size = input('Enter size symbol: ')

    if size == 'S':
        print('S: Small size')
    elif size == 'M':
        print(...)
    ...
    else:
    ...
    ```

1. The car has three driving modes: Auto (A), Manual (M) and Eco (E). In each of these three modes, the average fuel consumption in liters per 100 km is 7, 9 and 6 respectively. Write a program that calculates total fuel consumption for a given distance in km and a given driving mode. Then, calculate the total fuel consumption for the following data:

    * distance 200 km, driving mode M (the result should be 18 liters) 
    * distance 400 km, driving mode A (the result should be 28 liters) 
    * distance 350 km, driving mode E (the result should be 21 liters) 

    ```python
    ###
    # The car has three driving modes: Auto (A), Manual (M) and Eco (E).
    # In each of these three modes, the average fuel consumption in liters
    # per 100 km is 7, 9 and 6 respectively. Write a program that calculates
    # total fuel consumption for a given distance in km and a given
    # driving mode.
    #
    driving_mode = input('Enter driving mode (A/M/E):')
    distance = int(input('Enter distance in km'))

    if driving_mode == 'A':
        fuel_consumption = 7 # liters per 100km
    elif driving_mode == 'M':
        ...        
    ...

    total_consumption = ...
    print('Total fuel consumption over a distance of ... km in driving mode ... is ... liters')
    ```

1. Write a program that acts as a simple calculator. The program asks the user to enter a symbol of mathematical operation (+, -, *, /) and two numbers. Then, the program performs the appropriate mathematical operation on the given numbers and returns the result. Using the program, calculate:

    * 2 + 3
    * 2 * 4
    * 3 - 5
    * 5 * 6

    ```python
    ###
    # Simple calculator
    # Asks the user to enter a symbol of mathematical operation (+, -, *, /)
    # and two numbers. The program should perform the appropriate
    # mathematical operation on the given numbers and return the result.   
    # 
    number1 = input ...
    number2 = input ...
    operator = input ...

    if operator == ...:
        result = ...
    elif ...
    ...
    ...

    # print result
    print(f'{number1} {operator} {number2} = {result}')
    ```

1. Write a program that calculates and prints the quarter of the year for a given month number (1..12). Then check the program's results for the months:

    12, 10, 9, 1

    ```python
    ###
    # Calculates and prints the quarter of the year for a given
    # month number (1..12)
    #
    month = int(input('Enter month number (1..12): '))

    if month >= 10:
        quarter = 4
    elif ...:
        ...

    print('Month {...} is in quarter {...}')
    ```

1. Write a program that checks what number was entered from the keyboard and prints one of the messages below. Then run the program and check the following numbers:

    7, 1 ,0 ,-1 , -4

    * Number ... is positive
    * Number ... is negative
    * Number is 0

## 3. Logical Operators

1. You can combine conditions using logical operators like **and**, **or**, and **not**:

    * **and**: All conditions must be true.
    * **or**: At least one condition must be true.
    * **not**: Inverts the logical value of the condition.

1. Write a program that checks whether the entered login and password are correct.

    ```python
    ###
    # Checking login and password
    #
    login = 'joe'
    password = 'abcd'
    entered_login = input('Login: ')
    entered_password = input('Password: ')
    if login == entered_login and ... :
        print('You are logged in')
    else
        print('Incorrect login or password!!')
    ```

1. The discount is available to children under 18, or people 65 or older. Write a program that checks whether a person of a given age is eligible for the discount. Then use the program to check if people of the age listed below are eligible for a discount.

    72 (discount), 65 (discount), 64, 18, 17 (discount)

    ```python
    ###
    # Checking if discount is available
    # The discount is available to children under 18,
    # or people 65 or older.
    #
    age = int(input('Enter your age: '))

    if age < 18 or ... :
        print(...)
    else:
        print(...)
    ```

1. A user enters two integer numbers from the keyboard. Write a program
    that checks whether at least one of them is not negative.

    ```python
    ###
    # Checks whether at least one number entered
    # from the keyboard is not negative
    # 
    x = int(input('Enter first number: '))
    y = ...
    
    if not x < ... or ... :
        print(f'At least one of the numbers {} and {} is not negative')
    ```

1. Write a program that calculates and prints the number of days in a given month (1..12). Assume that February always has 28 days.

    ```python
    ###
    # Calculates the number of days in a month
    #
    month = int(input('Enter month number (1..12)'))
    
    if month==1 or month==3 or ... :
        days = 31 ## months with 31 days
    elif ... :
        days = ... ## months with 30 days
    ...
    ## February 28 days 
    
    print('Month ... has ... days')
    ```

1. Write a program that checks if the given day number of the month is correct. Then, run the program for the following data:

    * month 3, day 17
    * month 9, day 31
    * month 2, day 30

    ```python
    ###
    # Checks if the given day number of the month is correct
    #
    month = int(input('Enter month number (1..12): '))
    day = int(input('Enter the day number of the month: '))
    day_ok = False
    
    if month==1 or month==3 or ...:
        if day >=1 and day <= 31:
            day_ok = True
    elif month== ...:
        if day >=1 and day <= ...:
            ...
    ...
    
    message = f'Day {...} for the month {...}'
    if day_ok:
        print('{message} is correct')
    else
        print(...)
    ```

## 4. Iteration Over a Sequence

1. Watch the video on using the **for** statement:

    <https://youtu.be/KWgYha0clzw?feature=shared>

1. The **for** loop is used to iterate over a sequence and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

    Here is the basic syntax of the **for** statement:

    ```python
    for item in sequence:
        # code block to execute
    ```

    Look at the following example, which takes every character from a string and prints it on the screen. Then run the program.

    ```python
    city = 'Krakow'
    for char in city:
        print(char)
    ```

    You can use range() to loop over numbers:

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    ```

1. The following program prints the sentence "Practice makes perfect!" four times. Modify the program to print the text six times. Then run the program.

    ```python
    for i in range(4):
        print('Practice makes perfect!')
    ```

1. Write a program that prints the name of university where you are studying with an extra space between characters (add a space between each character).

    ```python
    ###
    # Prints the name of university where you are studying
    # with an extra space between characters (add a space between
    # each character), e.g.
    # 'book' -> 'b o o k'
    #
    university = 'Krakow University of Economics'
    university_expanded = ''

    for char in university:
        university_expanded = university_expanded + ... + ...

    print(...) # original university name
    print(...) # expanded university name
    ```

    Sample result:

    ```
    Krakow University of Economics
    K r a k o w   U n i v e r s i t y   o f   E c o n o m i c s
    ```

1. The Caesar cipher (also known as Caesar's code or Caesar shift) is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It is named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate secretly with his generals. The cipher is a type of substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. 

    Write a program that encrypts text using Caesar Code, shifting each letter in the alphabet right one position.

    ```python
    ###
    # Encrypts text using Caesar Code, shifting each letter
    # in the alphabet right one position
    #
    plain_text = 'The early bird catches the worm'
    encrypted_text = ''

    for char in plain_text:
        # read the character's code (use ord())
        ...
        # add one to the character's code
        ...
        # replace new character code with its
        # corresponding character (use chr())
        ...
        # add encrypted character to encrypted text
        ...

    print(plain_text...)
    print(encrypted_text...)
    ```

1. The following program calculates the sum of integer numbers in the range \<1,5\>. Make the following changes to the program:

    * sum the numbers from 5 to 10
    * use the **+=** operator in the expression **sum=sum+i**

    ```python
    ###
    # Calculates the sum of integer numbers in the range <1,5>
    #
    sum = 0

    for i in range(1,6):
        sum = sum + i
    
    print(f'Sum is {sum}')
    ```

1. Write a program that calculates the sum of even numbers in the range \<1,10\>.

    ```python
    ###
    # Calculates the sum of even numbers in the range <1,10>
    #
    sum = 0
    
    for i n range(...):
        if not i%2...:
            continue
        sum += ...
    
    print('Sum of even numbers in the range <1,10> is ...')
    ```

1. Write a program that calculates values for the following fractions: 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/10. Sample result:

    1/1 = 1.0\
    1/2 = 0.5\
    1/3 = 0.3333333333333333\
    ...\
    1/10 = 0.1

    ```python
    ###
    # Calculates values for the following fractions: 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/10
    #
    for i in range(...):
        print('1/{...} = {...}')
    ```

## 5. Conditional Iteration

1. Watch the video on using the **while** statement:

    <https://youtu.be/APWy6Pc83gE?feature=shared>


1. The ***while** loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.

    Here is the basic syntax of the **while** statement:

    ```python
    while condition:
        # code block to execute
    ```

    Look at the following example. Then try to run the program.

    ```python
    count = 0
    while count < 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1
    ```

1. 
    ```python
    ###
    # Prints a greeting
    #
    name = ''

    while name == '':
        name = input('Enter your name: ')

    print(f'Hello {name}')
    ```

1. The program below is a simple number guessing game. Analyze the program code. Then complete the program. 

    ```python
    ###
    # A simple number guessing game
    #
    import random

    # Randomly chosen number to be guessed from 1 to 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    user_guess = 0

    print("Guess the number between 1 and 100!")

    while user_guess != number_to_guess:
        user_guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))

        if user_guess < ...:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif ...:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.")
    ```

1. The following program sums numbers input by the user until they enter 0. Modify the program so that it also calculates the arithmetic mean of the numbers.

    ```python
    ###
    # Sums numbers entered by user
    #
    total_sum = 0

    while True:
        number = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))
        
        if number == 0:
            break  # Exit the loop when 0 is entered
        total_sum += number

    print(f"The total sum of the numbers is: {total_sum}")
    ```

1. The following program calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to a given number N using a for loop. Modify the program. Replace the 'for' statement with a 'while' statement.

    ```python
    ###
    # Calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to a given number N
    #
    N = 10
    sum_even = 0

    # Calculate the sum of even numbers
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += i

    print(f"The sum of even numbers from 1 to {N} is: {sum_even}")
    ```



1. The timer.py program takes a number from the user and counts down to zero. Modify the program so that the last five seconds of the counter are printed in words, i.e. five, four, three, two, one.

1. The atm.py program simulates a simple ATM where the user can deposit, withdraw, or check the balance. Analyze the program code and then run the program. Next, add two more functions to the program:

    * Check PIN
    * Change PIN

    The PIN should consist of exactly 4 digits. To check if a string contains only digits, you can use the isdigit() method. This method returns True if all characters in the string are digits and False otherwise:

    <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-isdigit-method/>



## 6. Practice Makes Perfect

1. Read the chapter in your class textbook that covers the topics in this section.

1. The vowels.py program counts vowels in the text. Modify the program. Replace the 'for' statement with a 'while' statement. 

1. A lamp in a room has three light bulbs. Switch one lights one bulb, and switch two lights the other two bulbs. Write a program that tells you how many bulbs are lit, depending on the state of switch one and switch two.

    ```python
    ###
    # House lighting with three bulbs and two switches
    # Checking how many bulbs are illuminating the house
    #
    light_switch1 = False # False - switch off, True - switch on
    light_switch2 = False
    bulbs_on = 0
    if light_switch1:
        bulbs_on += 1
    if light_switch2:
        ...
    print(...)
    ```

1. Password length has a significant impact on the level of data protection. Write a program that checks whether the new password provided is at least 12 characters long.

    ```python
    ###
    # Password validator
    # New password is at least 12 characters long
    #
    new_password = input('Enter new password: ')
    if len(...) < ...:
       print('Password too short (min. 12 chars)') 
    ```

1. The electronic thermometer prints the temperature in degrees Celsius and verbal information according to the following criteria:

    * It is extremely hot, for a temperature above 35 degrees,
    * It is hot, for a temperature above 30 degrees,
    * It is warm, for a temperature of at least 15 degrees,
    * It is cold, for a temperature of at least 0 degrees,
    * Warning, frost, for a temperature below 0 degrees.

    Write a program that simulates the operation of an electronic thermometer. Then check the correctness of the program for the following temperatures in degrees Celsius: 

    33, 30, 8, 0, -2

    ```python
    ###
    # Program that simulates the operation of an electronic thermometer.
    #
    temperature = 32
    if temperature > 35:
        print("It is extermely hot")
    elif temperature > 30:
        print ...
    elif ...
    ```

1. The parking meter calculates the parking fee based on the number of hours the car was parked according to the following rules:

    * 1-2 hours: 5 PLN
    * 3-6 hours: 15 PLN
    * Over 6 hours: 20 PLN

    Write a program that asks for the number of hours of parking, then calculates and prints the correct fee.

1. Write a program that asks the user for their age and then checks which age group they belong to:

    * Child: under 13
    * Teen: 13 to 19
    * Adult: 20 to 64
    * Senior: 65 or older

1. Write a program that checks that both people are adults. Read
    people's data from the keyboard.

    ```python
    ###
    # Checking if both people are adults
    #
    person1_name = input('Enter first person name: ')
    person1_age = int(input('Enter first person age: '))
    person2_name = ...
    person2_age = ...
    if person1_age >= 18 and person2 ...:
        print('Both {person1_name} and {...} are ...')
    else:
        print('Either {...} or {...} is not an adult')
    ```
