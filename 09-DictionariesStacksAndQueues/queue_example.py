import queue

"""
A queue is a linear data structure that follows
the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
This means that the first element added to the queue
will be the first one to be removed. A queue operates
similarly to a real-life queue, such as a line of people
waiting for a service â€” the person who arrives first
is served first.

## prints number of elements of the queue
print('Number of queue elements:', people.qsize())
