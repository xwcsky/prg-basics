# DICTIONARIES, STACKS AND QUEUES

## 1. Dictionary

1. A dictionary is a built-in data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to a specific value, allowing you to efficiently retrieve, update, and manage data. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can modify their content after they are created.

   Look at the dictionary below. It contains three elements, separated by commas. Each element in a dictionary consists of a key and a value, where the key acts as an identifier for accessing the associated value.

   ```python
   student = {'name':'John', 'age':25, 'major':'Computer Science'}
   ```

1. Familiarize yourself with the basic operations you can perform on a dictionary.


   **Basic Dictionary Operations**

   ```python
   # Create a dictionary
   student = {
      'name': 'John',
      'age': 22,
      'major': 'Computer Science'
   }

   # Accessing a value
   print(student['name'])

   # Adding a new key-value pair
   student['grade'] = 'A'

   # Modifying an existing value
   student['age'] = 23

   # Deleting a key-value pair
   del student['major']
   print(student)
   ```

   **Iterating Over a Dictionary**

   ```python
   # Create a dictionary
   fruits = {'apple': 3, 'banana': 5, 'orange': 2}

   # Iterating over keys
   for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)

   # Iterating over values
   for count in fruits.values():
      print(count)

   # Iterating over key-value pairs
   for fruit, count in fruits.items():
      print(f"The count of {fruit} is {count}")
   ```

   **Checking if a Key Exists**

   ```python
   # Create a dictionary
   person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

   # Check if a key exists
   if 'name' in person:
      print("Name is present in the dictionary.")
   else:
      print("Name is not present.")
   ```

1. Create a dictionary describing your mobile phone. Use 6 key-value pairs of data. Then, using `for` loop, display the contents of the dictionary. To read a key and value, use the `items()` method. Sample result:

   ```python
   mobile = {
   "OS":"Android",
      …
      …
      …
      …
      …
   }
   for key,value in mobile.items():
      print(f"{key} : {…}")
   ```

1. Create a dictionary as in the example below. Do you know what type of value was used in each of the six key-value pairs?

   ```python
   person = {
      "name": "Marek",
      "surname": "Banach",
      "age": 25,
      "hobby": ["swimming","excursions"],
      "married": True,
      "phone":{"landline":"123444321","mobile":"777888999"}
   }
   ```

   Then, create a program that:

   1. Displays name
   1. Displays hobby
   1. Displays the entire contents of the dictionary
   1. Changes surname to 'Nowak'
   1. Changes person's marriage status
   1. Adds gender: 'male'
   1. Adds a new hobby: 'bicycle'
   1. Adds work phone to existing phones: '313131444'
   1. Displays the entire contents of the dictionary (iterate over dictionary items)


1. Create an array with 5 dictionaries, each containing a country and its population. Then, print the array contents. Sample result:

   ```
   COUNTRY  POPULATION
   Poland   38000000
   …        …
   …        …
   …        …
   …        …
   ```

   ```python
   countries = [
   {"name":"Poland", "population":38000000},
      …
      …
      …
      …
   ]
   ```

1. Write a program that prints details of people from the phone book whose names start with the letter 'D'.

   ```python
   phone_book = {
      'John': '555-1234',
      'David': '555-5678',
      'Bob': '555-8765',
      'Charlie': '555-4321',
      'Diana': '555-9876',
      'Eve': '555-6543',
      'Frank': '555-3456',
      'Grace': '555-7890',
      'Hank': '555-1111',
      'Ivy': '555-2222',
      'Jack': '555-3333',
      'Daniel': '555-4444',
      'Liam': '555-5555',
      'Mia': '555-6666',
      'Nina': '555-7777',
      'Oscar': '555-8888',
      'Paul': '555-9999',
      'Dominic': '555-1010',
      'Rachel': '555-2020',
      'Sam': '555-3030'
   }

   ...
   ...
   ...
   ```

1. The following data contains information about the number of products available in a computer store. Write a program that prints:

   * a list of products and the quantity
   * the total number of products in the store

   ```python
   {
   'Laptop': 15,
   'Desktop PC': 10,
   'Monitor': 25,
   'Keyboard': 50,
   'Mouse': 60,
   'External Hard Drive': 30,
   'Printer': 12,
   'Router': 20,
   'USB Flash Drive': 100,
   'Graphics Card': 8
   }
   ```

1. The data below contains a price list of items from a clothing store along with their prices. Due to a seasonal sale, the store is reducing the price of each item by 10%. Write a program that:

   * prints a list of products and their prices before the discount
   * prints the total value of the products before the discount
   * modifies the price list according to the discount (round prices to two decimal places)
   * prints a list of products and their prices after the 10% discount
   * prints the total value of the products after the discount

   ```python
   price_list = {
      'T-shirt': 19.99,
      'Jeans': 49.99,
      'Jacket': 89.99,
      'Sneakers': 59.99,
      'Hat': 15.99
   }
   ```

## 2. Set

1. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful when you want to store a collection of items and ensure that there are no duplicates. Unlike lists or arrays, sets do not maintain the order of the elements, and you cannot access elements by index. They support fast membership tests, union, intersection, difference, and other set operations.

   Set Operations:
   * `&` (Intersection): Finds common elements between sets.
   * `|` (Union): Combines all elements from both sets (removes duplicates).
   * `-` (Difference): Finds elements present in one set but not the other.
   * `^` (Symmetric Difference): Finds elements present in either set but not in both.
   * `.issubset()`: Checks if one set is a subset of another.

1. The following program removes duplicate email addresses. Complete and run the program.

   ```python
   emails = ["john@example.com", "jane@example.com", "john@example.com", "alex@example.com"]
   unique_emails = set(...)  # Removes duplicates
   print(unique_emails)
   ```

1. The following program identifies students who are absent. Complete and run the program.

   ```python
   all_students = {"Alice", "John", "Sara", "Bob"}
   attended_students = {"Alice", "Bob"}

   absent_students = ... - ...  # Difference
   print(absent_students)
   ```

1. The program below finds spam in received emails. Complete the program that displays those received email addresses that are on the spam list.

   ```python
   emails_received = {"john@example.com", "spam1@example.com", "spam2@example.com", "jane@example.com"}
   spam_list = {"spam1@example.com", "spam2@example.com"}

   spam_emails = ... ... ...  # Intersection
   print("Spam emails:", spam_emails)
   ```

1. Two contact lists retrieved from a database contain email addresses. Write a program that combines these lists and simultaneously removes duplicates.

   ```python
   contacts_A = {"john@example.com", "alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"}
   contacts_B = {"bob@example.com", "michael@example.com", "sara@example.com"}

   merged_contacts = ... ... ...  # Union
   print("Merged contacts:", merged_contacts)
   ```

1. In an operating system, each user has some permissions. The user wants to perform some action that requires specific permissions. Write a program that checks whether the user has the required persmission.

   ```python
   required_permissions = {"read", "write", "execute"}
   user_permissions = {"read", "write"}

   has_permissions = ...   # subset
   print(has_permissions)  # Will return False because "execute" is missing.
   ```

## 3. Stack

1. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of a stack as a pile of plates — the last plate you place on the top is the first one you'll take off.

   ![Stack Data Structure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240606180325/What-is-Stack-(1).webp)

   In the stack_example.py file you can find a simple example of how to create and manipulate a stack. Analyze and run the program. Then, modify a program in which perform the following operations:
   
      1. Put 2 on the stack
      1. Put 3 on the stack
      1. Put 7 on the stack
      1. Put 4 on the stack
      1. Put 1 on the stack
      1. Put 9 on the stack
      1. Put 8 on the stack
      1. Sum the last two numbers of the stack and print result
      1. Calculate the sum of the remaining stack elements and print the result. Use a 'while' loop.
      
1. A `back.py` program simulates the Back key in a web browser (recording the name of new website or displaying the previously visited web site). Complete the program.

1. Define a function that returns true if the brackets `()`, `{}`, `[]` are used correctly in the given expression. Otherwise, the function returns false. Then write a program that checks the correctness of the expressions given below.

   > Use a stack. Read the next characters of the expression. Skip all but the brackets. If it is an opening bracket, put it on the stack. If it is a closing bracket, get the item from the stack and compare whether it is a matching opening bracket.

   ```python
   import queue

   expression1 = "[(2+3)*4+5]/6-{(7*8)+[4]}" # brackets ok
   expression2 = "[(2+3]/4)"                 # brackets not correct
   expression3 = "(2-3*4+(5/6)"              # brackets not correct

   def brackets_ok(expression):
      ...
      ...
      ...
      return #True if brackets in expression are ok of False otherwise

   if brackets_ok(expression1):
      print(...)
   else
      ...

   if brackets_ok(expression2):
   ...
   ...
   ```

1. Write a program that converts any natural number to a binary number. Use the stack. To convert a number, divide the number by 2, each time taking the remainder of the division and putting the remainder on the stack. Repeat the division until the number you are dividing is zero. Then pop and display all values from the stack. Sample result for number 18:

   |Division|Remainder|
   | :-: | :-: |
   |18 / 2 = 9|0|
   |9 / 2 = 4|1|
   |4 / 2 = 2|0|
   |2 / 2 = 1|0|
   |1  / 2 = 0|1|

   ```
   Natural number: 18
   Binary number: 10010 
   ```

## 4. Queue

1. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. A queue operates similarly to a real-life queue, such as a line of people waiting for a service — the person who arrives first is served first.

   ![Queue Data Structure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240606165428/Introduction-to-Queue-(2).webp)

   In the `queue_example.py` file you can find a simple example of how to create and manipulate a queue. Analyze and run the program.

1. Using a queue, write a program that manages a queue of files to print.

   ```python
   import queue

   # creates a queue of files to print
   files_to_print = queue.Queue()

   while True:
      print('1. Add file to print')
      print('2. Print file')
      print('0. Quit')
      menu = input('Select an option: ')
      ...
      ...
      
      if menu == '1':
         file_name = input('Enter file name to print: ')
         # add new file to the end of the queue 
      ...

      elif ...:
         if # print queue not empty
            file_to_print = ...
            print(f'File {file_to_print} is currently being printed. Please wait!')
         else:
            print(...)

      elif menu == '0':
         break
   ```

## 5. Practice Makes Perfect

1. Read the chapter in your class textbook that covers the topics in this section.

1. Watch the video on using dictionaries in Python:

   <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-> 

1. Write a program to translate words from English to Polish. The user enters a word in English from the keyboard. The program displays the translation of the word or information that the translation is unavailable.

   ```python
   translations = {
      'computer': 'komputer',
      'mouse': 'myszka',
      'keyboard': 'klawiatura',
      'printer': 'drukarka'
   }
   ...
   ...
   ...
   ```

1. A dictionary contains course names along with the number of hours. Write a program that calculates and prints the total number of hours. Sample results:

   ```
   The total number of hours in the winter semester is …
   ```

   ```python
   winter_semester = {
      "math":60,
      "programming":30,
      "history":15
   }
   ```

1. Write a program that counts how many times each word appears in a paragraph. 

   > Hint: Check the dictionary to see if the next word appears in it. If so, increase the number of times the word appears by 1. You can easily split a paragraph into individual words using the `split()` method. Search the Internet for how to use it.

   ```python
   paragraph = "cat dog mouse cat rat cat mouse"
   ...
   ...
   ```

1. The program contains two dictionaries with personal data:

   ```python
   basic_data = {
      "name":"Barbara",
      "age":21
   }

   advanced_data = {
      "status":"student",
      "married":False,
      "interest":["reading","swimming"]
   }
   ```

   Write a program that creates a dictionary called `person` containing data from the two other dictionaries (five key-value pairs). Print the contents of the ‘person’ dictionary.

1. A program contains two functions:
   1. `hotel_list(hotels)` that returns a list of hotel names, separated by a comma sign
   1. `avg_price(hotels)` that returns the average room price for a given list of hotels, rounded to an integer value

   Write a program that calculates and displays the average price for a room in hotels in Krakow and Sopot and indicates in which cities hotels are cheaper. Sample result:

   ```
   Hotels in Krakow: …,…,…,…
   Average hotel price in Krakow: …
   Hotels in Sopot: …,…,…,…
   Average hotel price in Sopot: …
   Cheaper hotels in: …
   ```

   ```python
   hotels_in_Krakow = [
      {"name":"Sky","price":320.00},
      {"name":"Metropol","price":480.00},
      {"name":"New Port","price":420.00},
      {"name":"Aparthotel","price":390.00}
   ]

   hotels_in_Sopot = [
      {"name":"Focus","price":510.00},
      {"name":"Aqua","price":345.00},
      {"name":"La Boutique","price":390.00},
      {"name":"Marina","price":410.00}
   ]
   ```

1. Write a program to calculate the total cost of a shopping cart using a price list.

   ```python
   # Price list
   prices = {'milk': 1.49, 'butter': 2.09, 'juice': 1.19, 'bread': 1.99}

   # Shopping cart with quantities
   cart = {'juice': 3, 'bread': 1, 'milk': 2}

   # Calculate total cost
   ...
   ...
   ```

1. A traffic camera records passing vehicles. The camera saves their registration numbers in the file `vehicle.txt`. Write a program that calculates and prints how many registered cars come from each province of Poland. The list of provinces and the corresponding first letters of the vehicle registration numbers are contained in the file `province.csv`.

   > Hint: use the dictionary containing the letters corresponding to the provinces and the numbers of vehicles whose first letters of the registration number match the letters of the province.

1. Watch the video on how to deal with JSON files in Python:

   <https://youtu.be/pTT7HMqDnJw?feature=shared> 


1. Write a program to record voting. Voting results are saved in the voting.json file with the structure below. The program takes a person's name from the keyboard and increases the number of votes for that person by 1. If this is a new person, they are added to the list with a vote count of 1. You can run the program multiple times to add additional votes to the json file.

   ```python
   {
      person_name: number of votes,
      person_name: number of votes,
      ...
      ...
   }

   # Read the contents of the json file
   ...
   
   # Vote for a person
   person_name = input('Name of the person you are voting for:')
   ...
 
   # Save voting data to json file
   ...
   ```

1. Define a function that takes a string as input and uses a stack to reverse it. Then, write a program to reverse any text entered from the keyboard.
   
   > Hint: Push each character of the string onto the stack, then pop characters to form the reversed string.

1. Search the Internet and familiarise yourself with RPN (Reverse Polish Notation). Then, write a program that calculates RPN expressions. RPN can be conveniently evaluated using a stack structure. A user can enter from the keyboard any number, an operator (+ - \* / ) or the equal sign (=).

   1. If the entered value is a number, push the number on to the stack
   1. If the entered value is an operator, pop two items from the top of the stack, do the calculation, and push the result of the operation on to the stack.
   1. If the entered value is an equal sign, pop the final result from the stack and display the result of calculation.

   Then, using the program, calculate the value of RPN expressions:

   |Expression|RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)|
   | :- | :- |
   |2 + 3 =|2 3 + =|
   |2 \* (4 + 1)|2 4 1 + \* =|
   |(2 + 3) \* ( 4 + 5) =|2 3 + 4 5 + \* =|
   |8 / (3 + 1) \* (3 - 2 + 4) = |8 3 1 + / 3 2 – 4 + \* =|

1. Write a program that supports customer service in an office. Use the queue. Each new customer receives a ticket with an automatically assigned consecutive number and is added to the end of the queue. The next customer to be served is taken from the beginning of the queue.

1. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, as well as to store structured data.

   Note the key characteristics of JSON:

   * Readability: JSON is text-based, so it can be easily read by humans.
   * Simplicity: It is built on key-value pairs.
   * Language Agnostic: Although it derives from JavaScript, JSON is supported by many programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, C#, and more.

1. The computer.json file contains sample computer data. Open the json file in an editor and review its contents. Notice that the file contains a single dictionary of data.

   Then, write a program that prints information about a computer.

   ```python
   import json

   # Open the JSON file in read mode
   with open('computer.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
      # Load the data from the JSON file into a variable
      data = json.load(file)

   # Print the JSON data
   for ... , ... in data.items():
      print(...,':',value)
   ```

1. The cities.json file contains data about selected cities in Poland. Open the json file in an editor and review its contents. Notice that the file contains an array of dictionaries.

   Then, write a program that prints information about cities.

   > Note: using the encoding='utf-8' parameter when opening the file is necessary because the json file also contains Polish characters in city names that must be processed correctly. Remember to always use this parameter when opening files that contain characters other than those in the Latin alphabet.

   ```python
   import json

   # Open the JSON file in read mode
   with open('cities.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
      # Load the data from the JSON file into a variable
      data = json.load(file)

   # Print the JSON data
   for city in data:
      for ... , ... in city. ...():
         print(key,':',value)
      print()
   ```

1. The file dogs.json contains data about dogs. Write a program that prints information about dogs younger than 5 years.

1. The hotel's IT system contains a list of reserved rooms. The data is contained in the reservations.json file. Write a program that prints the summary information as stated below. Break your program into smaller parts defining functions.

   * number of rooms
   * number of paid reservations
   * number of unpaid reservations
   * total value of paid reservations
   * total value of unpaid reservations

1. The following program writes data to a json file. Analyze this program. Then, run the program and see if the json file is created. Display the created json file in the editor.

   ```python
   import json

   data = {
      "patient_record": {
         "patient_id": "P001234",
         "first_name": "John",
         "last_name": "Doe",
         "date_of_birth": "1985-05-15",
         "gender": "Male",
         "contact_info": {
               "phone_number": "+1-555-123-4567",
               "email": "johndoe@example.com",
               "address": {
                  "street": "123 Main St",
                  "city": "New York",
                  "state": "NY",
                  "postal_code": "10001",
                  "country": "USA"
               }
         },
         "medical_history": {
               "allergies": ["Penicillin", "Peanuts"],
               "current_medications": ["Lisinopril 10mg", "Metformin 500mg"],
               "past_illnesses": ["Hypertension", "Type 2 Diabetes"],
               "surgeries": [
                  {
                     "surgery_type": "Appendectomy",
                     "date": "2015-08-20"
                  }
               ]
         }
      }
   }

   # Specify the file path and name
   file_name = "patient.json"

   # Open the file in write mode and use json.dump() to write the data to the file
   with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
      json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

   print("Data has been written to", file_name)
   ```

1. Create a dictionary that describes your favorite book or movie with at least five key-value pairs. Then, create a program that writes the dictionary data to the favourite.json file.

1. Write a program that takes data from the keyboard about a purchased product:

   * name
   * price (real number with two decimal places)
   * paid (yes/no)

   The program then saves the product data in the product.json file. Pay attention to the correct data types describing the product (string, float, bool).

   ```python
   product = {}
   
   # read product data from keyboard
   ...

   # save product data to json file
   ...
   ```
